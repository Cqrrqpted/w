## 🧠 What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method that breaks work into intervals:
- **25 minutes** of focused study (called a "Pomodoro")
- **5 minutes** of break
- After 4 cycles, take a longer break

This method improves focus, reduces mental fatigue, and boosts productivity.
